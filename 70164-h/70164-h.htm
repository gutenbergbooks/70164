<p>It will be seen that fish has been excluded from this little volume,
because it does not come within the range of legitimate vegetarian
fare; although many who “bid adieu to carnal dishes, to solid meats,
and highly-spiced ragouts,” give it a prominent place in the daily menu.</p>

<p>I trust those who put the recipes given herein to the test will find
they merit the somewhat ambitious title under which they appear. My aim
is to suggest dainty and nourishing dishes to vegetarians, which are
not extravagant, and which can be easily carried out by the average
“good plain” cook. One thing I would ask in this connection is, that
the recipe be read through and the intention grasped before operations
are begun. It is an interesting fact that the same recipe may give an
absolutely different result when followed by two persons, thus proving
that in one case or the other—and possibly in both—their methods are
at variance with those laid down by the author. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> must be borne in
mind that fats of various kinds, such as butter—made both from cream
and nuts—cream, oil, and cheese, should necessarily take a prominent
place in vegetarian fare, and also such complete forms of food as milk
and eggs, in order to give it its proper dietetic value.</p>

<p>It is frequently asserted that a vegetarian diet is more costly than
a meat diet, but those who adopt it will find that the extra cost of
butter, milk, and eggs in a month will compare favourably with the
butcher’s bill for the same period.</p>

<p>One pound artichokes, 4 hard-boiled eggs, ³⁄₄ pint white sauce, 2
oz. macaroni, grated cheese, 1 oz. butter, tomato sauce, 1 raw yolk,
lemon-juice.</p>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Cook the artichokes until they are just tender and cut
them into rather thick slices. Then cut as many hard-boiled eggs as are
required for the dish (allow one for each person and one over) also
into slices, and heat the artichokes and eggs in the white sauce, which

them into little balls (the size of a large marble) and cook them in
salted water until they begin to get tender, then drain them at once
and put them into a saucepan containing some warm butter (dairy or nut

about ten minutes. Prepare a thick white sauce (see recipe on <a href="#Page_106">page 106</a>)
and add a tablespoonful of mild, grated cheese to each half pint; pour
a small quantity of the sauce over a buttered gratin dish and arrange
the artichokes in it, then cover them with the remainder of the sauce;
pour the remains of the butter in which the artichokes were cooked over
the top and scatter over it a moderately thick layer of finely sifted,
dried bread-crumbs mixed with half the quantity of grated cheese, and
bake in a quick oven until evenly browned. If the flavour of onion is
not objected to, a small, well-boiled Spanish onion passed through a
sieve and added to the sauce is an improvement to the dish.</p>

then add the peas and simmer them for ten minutes in the butter,
turning them constantly with a wooden spoon; at the end of the time
season with salt, pepper, and castor sugar, add the mint and a quarter

a little more water may be added, but it is not intended there should
be much, and when done it should be nearly all absorbed, and then two

against the sides with the handle of a small spoon, so as to leave the
middle hollow; fill them according to the directions given below, then
make a rose (by means of a forcer) with the mashed potato left over,
sufficiently large to cover the hole; brush the rose over with warm
butter and put the potatoes into a hot oven for ten or fifteen minutes.
While the white sauce (which should be rather thicker than is usually
required) is still hot, add the grated cheese (preferably Gruyère)
and ascertain if any more seasoning is required, then a squeeze of
lemon-juice and the eggs cut into slices, and fill the potatoes with
the mixture. Serve with a salad composed of lettuce, beetroot, and
celery.</p>

a small quantity (a quarter of a pint to a pint mould) of milk over
them, then replace the paper, and let them finish cooking. When ready,
turn the potatoes out of the mould (they will be a compact mass) and
sprinkle some chopped parsley over the top.</p>

<p>One pound tomatoes, 3 ozs. butter, 1¹⁄₂ ozs. potato flour, 1 oz. onion
(scalded and minced), 3 eggs, rather less than ¹⁄₂ pint milk, Parmesan
or Gruyère cheese (grated), seasoning, ¹⁄₂ pint celery sauce.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Method.</i>—Slice the tomatoes and cook them with the onion in one
ounce of butter until they are tender, then pass them through a sieve.
Melt two ounces of butter and stir in the flour, and when smoothly
mixed, moisten gradually with the milk, stirring quickly until a very
thick sauce is made; turn the latter into a basin, and add the yolks
of the eggs, season with salt, pepper, a very little mixed spice, and
a large tablespoonful of grated cheese, then stir in half a pint of
the tomato pulp (straining off any excess of juice), and lastly the
whites of the eggs whisked to a very stiff froth. Put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span> the mixture into
a buttered soufflé mould (or basin) without quite filling it; tie a
buttered paper over the top and steam steadily (but not rapidly) for
from half an hour to forty minutes, when the soufflé should feel firm.
Turn it out carefully, surround it with celery sauce, and serve with
fried potatoes prepared as follows: Peel some potatoes, cut them into
quarters (select the firm, not floury kind), and parboil them in hot
salted water, then drain them and turn them on to a floured cloth to
dry. Heat plenty of fat in a sauté pan, and when it reaches boiling
point put in the potatoes and let them cook until they are a golden
brown; drain them from the fat, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and some
chopped parsley, and they will be ready to serve.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Half a peck young peas (cooked and sieved), 1 teaspoonful very finely
minced onion (previously scalded), 1 oz. butter, 1 oz. flour, ¹⁄₄ pint
milk, 1 teaspoonful tomato catsup, 1 tablespoonful grated Parmesan
cheese, seasoning, chopped mint, ³⁄₄ pint aspic jelly, 1 gill stiffly
whipped cream.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Method.</i>—Cook the onion in the butter with a little finely
chopped mint (the quantity should depend on whether the flavour is
liked) for a few moments, then stir in the flour, and when it is
smoothly mixed add the milk and continue to stir until a very thick
sauce is formed; season it with a little salt and pepper, rub it
through a gravy-strainer into the basin containing the sieved peas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
and mix well. Then add the tomato catsup and Parmesan cheese and season
with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; whisk one and a half gills of cool
aspic jelly until it is quite white, add the whipped cream to it, and
then the prepared peas, by degrees, and as soon as the ingredients are
thoroughly mixed, pour the cream into a mould which has been lined with
aspic jelly and leave until the following day, when it should be turned
out and served with aigrettes, made according to the directions given
below. If the peas are carefully cooked in an uncovered pan they should
produce a bright green purée, but should the colour not be good a few
drops of vegetable greening must be added. The cream may be iced with
advantage.</p>

<p><i>For the Aigrettes.</i>—Put one ounce of butter into a small
saucepan with half a pint of cold water; when it boils, draw the pan to
the side of the stove and stir in, gradually, four ounces of flour, and
continue to stir until a smooth and very thick paste is formed, which
leaves the sides of the pan and collects round the spoon in the middle;
then take the pan from the stove and, when the mixture has cooled a
little, beat two whole eggs and an additional yolk into it, adding
each separately, and when these are mixed stir in three ounces of dry,
grated cheese (preferably Parmesan and Gruyère mixed) and season with
salt, white pepper, and a little curry powder. As soon as the paste
is cool, dip a teaspoon into a stewpan containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span> plenty (it must be
deep) of clear fat, which has been heated to just under boiling point;
fill it with some of the paste and drop the latter into the fat. Avoid
putting many aigrettes into the pan at the same time, and be careful to
remove them as soon as they are a deep golden colour. Let the aigrettes
cool on a wire tray, and serve them cold with the vegetable cream; they
should not be made too long before they are required. The above makes a
good dish for a cold supper.</p>

eggs, forcemeat balls, 1 dessertspoonful onion (scalded and minced),
seasoning, brown vegetable stock (slightly thickened), ¹⁄₂ lb. short
paste.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Method.</i>—Butter a pie-dish and put in a layer of sliced
potatoes, then a few slices of tomato, three mushrooms (cut in half),
some of the beans, some pieces of celery (about an inch in length),
one hard-boiled egg divided into quarters, and four or five little
forcemeat balls; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and scatter
half the quantity of onion over the surface, then use the remaining
ingredients in the same way. Moisten the pie with the stock and cover
it with the paste, brush over with beaten egg (if practicable),
and bake in a well-heated oven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span> for an hour. For the forcemeat
balls proceed thus: Mix together four ounces Hovis breadcrumbs, one
dessertspoonful of minced parsley, a little lemon-thyme (if the flavour
is not disliked), a teaspoonful of onion (scalded and minced), a very
little grated lemon-peel, and season with salt, freshly-ground black
pepper, and cayenne; then add two ounces of warm butter and sufficient
beaten egg to form a fairly stiff paste. Divide the latter into little

butter, onion, tomatoes, and celery, and fry for six minutes, stirring
well; season with salt, pepper, and a dust of mixed spice, and pour in
the stock. Cover the beans closely with greased paper before putting
on the lid of the casserole, and let them cook in a moderate oven for
about two hours, or until they are reduced to a soft mass and the stock
is all absorbed. Pass the beans and vegetables through a wire sieve;
add the yolk of egg to the purée, mixing it thoroughly; put it aside

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Three ounces dry, sifted flour, 3 eggs, rather more than ¹⁄₄ pint
milk, baking powder, 2 ozs. butter, 4 mushrooms, 2 tomatoes, maître
d’hôtel butter, seasoning.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Method.</i>—Put the flour into a basin, add a little salt and some
freshly-ground black pepper, and make a hollow in the middle; whisk the
eggs well and mix the milk with them, then pour by degrees into the
flour, mixing it with a wooden spoon; when a perfectly smooth batter
is formed cover the basin with a cloth and let it stand for an hour
or two before cooking. Then melt the butter in a Yorkshire pudding
tin (ten by six inches), and when it is hot stir a saltspoonful of
baking powder into the batter, pour it into the hot tin, and bake in a
well-heated oven for from twenty to thirty minutes. While the pudding
is being cooked, fry two medium-sized tomatoes cut in half and four
fairly large mushrooms (cleansed and peeled); when the pudding is done
cut it into eight squares with a sharp knife and arrange them on a very
hot flat fireproof dish, place the mushrooms and tomatoes alternately
on the pieces, and put a little pat of maître d’hôtel butter on each;
it should be prepared thus: Beat three ounces of butter (or two ounces
if only for a small dish) until it is soft and creamy; season it with
salt, pepper, and cayenne, and add, by degrees, a tablespoonful of
lemon-juice; when it is thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span> worked into the butter sprinkle
in a tablespoonful of finely-minced parsley and put into a cool place

<h3>BROWN SAUCE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two and a half ounces of butter, 1 onion, 1 large or 2 small carrots,
a few pieces of celery, 1 tomato, ¹⁄₂ turnip, 1 thick slice parsnip, 2
or 3 pieces parsley, 1 clove, seasoning, browning, Maggi’s essence.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Slice the vegetables and let them simmer gently in
one ounce of the butter for a quarter of an hour; then add a pint of
boiling water, a teaspoonful of browning, a teaspoonful of Maggi’s
essence, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a dust of curry powder, and let it
boil rapidly for ten minutes; at the end of the time draw the pan to
the side of the stove and let the stock cook slowly for three quarters
of an hour. When it is ready thicken it with two ounces of flour, and
one and a half ounces of butter, cooked together, add a squeeze of
lemon-juice, or a few drops of tarragon vinegar, and strain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>


<h3>CURRY SAUCE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two ounces of butter, 4 ozs. onion, 1 or 2 tomatoes, ¹⁄₂ a sweet
apple, 2 teaspoonfuls sweet chutney, 1 dessertspoonful curry
powder, 1 dessertspoonful flour, 1 teaspoonful tarragon vinegar (or
lemon-juice), ³⁄₄ pint brown vegetable stock.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Slice the onion, tomatoes, and apple and fry in the
butter until the onion begins to show signs of becoming a golden
colour; then add the curry powder, and draw the pan to a cooler part
of the stove, and let the contents simmer for twelve minutes. At the
end of the time stir in the flour, taking care no lumps form, and when
it is smoothly mixed with the butter, pour in the stock gradually, and
stir until the sauce has boiled and thickened, then add the chutney and
tarragon vinegar, and let it simmer for half an hour, when it should be
passed through a gravy strainer into a basin (rubbing the ingredients
through with the back of a small wooden spoon) to be re-heated when
required.</p>


<h3>DUTCH SAUCE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Half a pint of thick white sauce, 1 raw yolk of egg, 1¹⁄₂ teaspoonfuls
lemon-juice, ¹⁄₂ oz. butter.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Make the white sauce hot, ascertain that it has
sufficient seasoning, and when it reaches boiling point draw the pan to
the side of the stove and stir in the yolk of egg beaten up with the
lemon-juice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> and continue to stir for a few moments until the egg has
thickened, but it must not boil or it will curdle and be spoilt. Then
remove the pan from the stove and stir in the butter (which should be
divided into little pieces) by degrees, and if the sauce is not to be
used at once, keep it hot by placing the saucepan in a larger vessel
of hot water. Dutch sauce is nice with almost any kind of vegetable
(including potatoes), and also with macaroni.</p>


<h3>TOMATO AND CELERY SAUCE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Half a pound of tomatoes, 3 or 4 nice white sticks of celery, 1 oz.
butter, seasoning, carmine, ¹⁄₂ pint white sauce.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Slice the tomatoes and cut the celery into small
pieces; melt the butter in a saucepan, put in the vegetables, season
them with salt, pepper, a very little powdered mace, and let them
simmer (not fry) for ten minutes. Then add the white sauce and leave
the pan where the heat is moderate until the vegetables are quite
tender, but the sauce must not be allowed to boil. When it is ready,
add a few drops of carmine and a squeeze of lemon-juice, and pass it
either through a perforated gravy strainer or a sieve, and re-heat it
carefully, letting it only just reach boiling point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>


<h3>TOMATO SAUCE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Three or four large tomatoes, 1¹⁄₂ ozs. sliced onion, 1¹⁄₂ ozs.
butter, 1¹⁄₂ pints thick brown sauce, seasoning, Chili vinegar,
carmine.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Cut the tomatoes into slices and fry them gently with
the onion in one ounce of the butter; season with salt, freshly-ground
black pepper, nutmeg, and a dust of castor sugar, and as soon as the
tomatoes are quite soft, add the brown sauce, a few drops of Chili
vinegar, and sufficient carmine to make it a clear red; then pass it
through a sieve and re-heat it when required, stirring in the remaining
half ounce of butter after taking the saucepan from the stove; this
will add richness to the sauce, but it should not be re-heated after
the butter is put in, or it will become oily instead of blending with
the sauce.</p>


<h3>WHITE SAUCE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One onion, a few pieces of celery, 2 or 3 thin strips lemon-peel, 2 or
3 pieces parsley, small blade of mace, salt, pepper, ³⁄₄ pint milk,
¹⁄₄ pint Plasmon stock, 2¹⁄₂ ozs. butter, 2 ozs. flour.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Cut the onion in slices and put it into a saucepan with
the celery and one ounce of butter, and let it simmer gently for ten
minutes, taking great care that the butter does not become discoloured,
then add the milk, Plasmon, lemon-peel, parsley, mace, salt, and
pepper, and let the stock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span> simmer gently (it must not boil) until the
vegetables are soft, when it should be strained into a basin. Melt the
remainder of the butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour. As soon
as the latter is well mixed, pour in the flavoured milk, by degrees,
stirring quickly all the time with a wooden spoon, so that no lumps
may form; then place the pan on a slightly hotter part of the stove,
so that the sauce may boil and thicken satisfactorily. If carefully
prepared, it will be perfectly smooth, otherwise it should be passed
through a gravy strainer; if an additional half ounce of butter can be
spared, it will improve the sauce to have it stirred in the last thing
before it is served.</p>


<h3>WHITE STOCK</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One onion, 1 carrot, 1 small turnip, a few pieces of celery, a thick
slice of parsnip, 2 artichokes, a little bunch of parsley, a little
piece of lemon-thyme, 1 clove, a little piece of mace, salt, pepper,
¹⁄₂ pint milk, ³⁄₄ pint water or Plasmon stock, 1 oz. of crumbs from a
milk loaf.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Slice the vegetables and put them into a saucepan with
the water, bread, herbs, and seasoning; let the water or stock reach
boiling point, and then simmer for half an hour; at the end of the time
add the milk and simmer again for twenty minutes, when the stock should
be strained and put aside until it is required.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
